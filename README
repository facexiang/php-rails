## Introduction ##
A brief summarization of what I18n is:

> Active record is an approach to access data in a database. A database table or view is wrapped into a class,
> thus an object instance is tied to a single row in the table. After creation of an object, a new row is added to
> the table upon save. Any object loaded gets its information from the database; when an object is updated, the
> corresponding row in the table is also updated. The wrapper class implements accessor methods or properties for
> each column in the table or view.

More details can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern).

This implementation is inspired and thus borrows heavily from Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord.
We have tried to maintain their conventions while deviating mainly because of convenience or necessity.
Of course, there are some differences which will be obvious to the user if they are familiar with rails.
